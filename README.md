# Portfolio

A modern, responsive developer portfolio website built to showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience. This project emphasizes clean UI/UX, performance, and code maintainability.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project is built with a modern frontend stack:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** - A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Typed JavaScript at Any Scale
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - A utility-first CSS framework
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** - Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Bun installed on your machine.
[Install Bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShreyasWeb3/minimal-portfolio.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
```bash
cd minimal-portfolio

```


3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
bun install

```


4. **Start the development server**
```bash
bun dev

```



The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080` .

## 📂 Project Structure

* `/src` - Contains the source code.
* `/components` - Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, etc.).
* `/pages` - Route components for different pages.
* `/assets` - Static assets like images and fonts.
* `/lib` - Utility functions and configurations.



## 🎨 Customization

To personalize this portfolio:

1. Update the content in the `src/pages` directory to reflect your bio and experience.
2. Modify `src/index.css` or `tailwind.config.js` to change the color scheme.
3. Add your project data and images to the relevant components.

## 📦 Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
bun run build

```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the optimized assets ready for deployment.

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy this project to any static hosting provider. Common choices include:

* **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo and Vercel will auto-detect the Vite/Bun settings.
* **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder or connect via Git.
* **GitHub Pages**: Configure the build action to deploy the `dist` folder.
